# Personal Guidelines

## Personal Style

- Do not write too much comments in the code. Only write comments when the code is not self-explanatory.
- If you are writing comments, make sure to use full sentences with proper punctuation and full stops at the end. But if the comment is just a single word or a short phrase, punctuation is not necessary.
- Use American English spelling (e.g., "color" instead of "colour", "organize" instead of "organise") for naming variables, comments, and documentation.

## Package Managers

- When inside a Python project, use `uv` for managing the environment and running files.
- When inside a Node.js project, use `pnpm` for managing the environment.

## Version Managers

- Use `fnm` for managing Node.js versions.
- Use `uv` for managing Python versions.
