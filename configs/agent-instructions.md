# Personal Guidelines

## Personal Style

- If you are writing comments, make sure to use full sentences with proper punctuation and full stops at the end. But if the comment is just a single word or a short phrase, punctuation is not necessary.
- Use American English spelling (e.g., "color" instead of "colour", "organize" instead of "organise") for naming variables, comments, and documentation.

## Package Managers

- When inside a Python project, use `uv` for managing the environment and running files.
- When inside a Node.js project, detect whether the project is using `pnpm` or `bun`. By default you should use `pnpm`.

## Version Managers

- Use `fnm` for managing Node.js versions.
- Use `uv` for managing Python versions.
