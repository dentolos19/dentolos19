# Coding Styles

## JavaScript/TypeScript/JSX/TSX

- Always add curly braces around every attribute values of a JSX element, expect for the content or children inside the JSX element.
- Do not use anonymous functions when declaring a standalone function. Always use a named function, unless it is being used as an inline callback.
- When handling asynchronous operations, always use callbacks or promises instead of async/await syntax.
- Don't use unnecessary class names or styles that do not affect the design or functionality of the component.

# Programming Tools

- When inside a Python project, use `uv` for managing the environment and running files.
- When inside a Node.js project, use `pnpm` for managing the environment.
