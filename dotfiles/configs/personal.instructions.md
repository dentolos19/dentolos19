- Always add curly braces around every attribute values of a JSX element, expect for the content or children inside the JSX element.
- Do not use anonymous functions when declaring a standalone function. Always use a named function, unless it is being used as an inline callback.
- When handling asynchronous operations, always use callbacks or promises instead of async/await syntax.
- Don't use unnecessary class names or styles that do not affect the design or functionality of the component.
